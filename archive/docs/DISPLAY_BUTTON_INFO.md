## DISPLAY BUTTON ON BACK

**DO NOT press the button yet.**

The button on the back of WaveShare displays is typically for:
- **Input selection** (HDMI1/HDMI2)
- **Settings menu** access
- **Power/reset** (rare)

---

## CURRENT ISSUE

The PeppyMeter display issue is **software-related** (window position/size), not hardware.

Pressing the button would likely:
- Switch input source (if it's an input button)
- Open settings menu (if it's a settings button)
- Not fix the window size issue

---

## SOLUTION

Fixing the window position and size in software:
- PeppyMeter window was at position -216,40 (off-screen)
- Moving it to 0,0
- Ensuring size is 1280x400

---

**Status:** Software fix in progress - button not needed
