## 🔧 WHAT I JUST DID

1. **Tested standard resolution (1280x720)**
   - Changed display to 1280x720 to test if display works
   - **Please check: Do you see image now at 1280x720?**

2. **Identified the issue:**
   - Old displays = Hardware damaged (flicker everywhere)
   - New display = May be configuration/cable issue

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

### **IMMEDIATE:**
1. **Check if 1280x720 shows image now**
   - If YES: Custom resolution problem → can be fixed

2. **If still only backlight:**
   - Try different HDMI cable
   - Try HDMI-A-1 port (other port on Pi 5)
   - Test display on laptop/computer to verify it works

### **FOR OLD DISPLAYS:**
- They are damaged/defective

## 🛠️ QUICK FIXES TO TRY

1. **Different HDMI cable:**
