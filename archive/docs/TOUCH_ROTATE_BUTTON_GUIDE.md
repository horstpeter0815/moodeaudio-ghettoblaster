## TOUCH ROTATE BUTTON

The display has a **rotate touch button** on the back that cycles through touch calibration modes.

---

## WHEN TO USE IT

Use the rotate touch button if:
- Touch coordinates don't match where you touch
- Touch works but is rotated incorrectly (e.g., touching top-left registers as bottom-right)
- After changing display orientation

---

## HOW IT WORKS

The button typically cycles through:
- **0°** (normal)
- **90°** (clockwise)
- **180°** (upside down)
- **270°** (counter-clockwise)

---

## CURRENT CONFIGURATION

- **Display:** Landscape (1280x400)
- **Touch Matrix:** 270° rotation (0 -1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1)
- **Touch Events:** Now enabled

---

## TESTING PROCEDURE

1. **Test current touch:**
   - Touch different corners of the screen
   - Verify if cursor appears where you touch

2. **If misaligned:**
   - Press the rotate touch button once
   - Test again
   - Repeat until touch matches display

3. **If still not working:**
   - May need software calibration adjustment
   - Check touch event logs

## IMPORTANT

**Touch events were disabled** - I've now enabled them. Test touch first before using the rotate button.

---

**Status:** Touch events enabled - test before using rotate button
