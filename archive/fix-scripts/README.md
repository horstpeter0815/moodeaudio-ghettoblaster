# Archived Fix Scripts

These are temporary fix scripts that were used during development/debugging but are no longer needed in the active codebase.

## Date Archived: 2025-12-27

## Reason
These scripts created clutter in the root directory and were temporary solutions during development. They have been moved here to keep the root directory clean while preserving history.

## Scripts
- Various FIX_*.sh scripts
- fix-*.sh scripts
- Temporary debugging/fixing scripts

## Note
If you need to reference any of these scripts, they are preserved here for historical purposes. However, the proper fixes should be integrated into the build system or custom-components rather than standalone scripts.
