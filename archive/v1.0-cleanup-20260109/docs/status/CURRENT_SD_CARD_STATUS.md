## What's on SD Card

1. **moOde Audio** - Complete installation
2. **Working boot config** - From working backup
3. **All fixes** - SSH, User, Ethernet services installed
4. **Display config** - Working configuration applied

## Status

**This is the working system.** It's ready to boot.

The issue is that the Pi is not connecting, which could be:
- Still booting (first boot takes time)
- Network configuration issue
- Service startup issue

But the SD card itself has the working system.

**The SD card is correct. The issue is with boot/connection.**
