# ✅ Ethernet Connection Status

**Current Status:**

✅ **Mac Configured:** `192.168.10.1`  
⚠️ **Pi Detected:** `192.168.10.2` (incomplete in ARP table)  
⏳ **Connection:** Pi might need more time to configure Ethernet

---

## 🔍 WHAT I SEE

- ✅ Mac Ethernet interface `en8` is configured correctly
- ✅ Mac has IP: `192.168.10.1`
- ⚠️ Pi at `192.168.10.2` is detected but not fully responding yet
- ⏳ Pi might still be configuring its Ethernet interface

---

## ⏰ WAIT A BIT

**The Pi might need 30-60 seconds to:**
1. Detect Ethernet cable
2. Configure its Ethernet interface
3. Start network services

**Try again in 30 seconds!**

## 🌐 TEST IN BROWSER

**While waiting, try opening in browser:**
```
http://192.168.10.2
```

**If it loads, great! If not, wait 30 seconds and try again.**

## 🔧 IF STILL NOT WORKING

**The Pi might need to be rebooted with Ethernet cable connected, or:**
1. Check if Pi's Ethernet LED is blinking
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for full boot
3. Try unplugging and replugging Ethernet cable

---

**Status: Mac is ready, waiting for Pi to respond!**
