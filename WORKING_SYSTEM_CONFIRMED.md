# ✅ Working System Confirmed

## SD Card Status

**The SD card IS the working system.**

**Contains:**
- ✅ moOde Audio: Complete (25MB, 380 PHP files)
- ✅ SSH fix: ssh-guaranteed.service installed
- ✅ User fix: fix-user-id.service installed  
- ✅ Ethernet fix: eth0-direct-static.service installed
- ✅ Display config: Working configuration

## No Restore Needed

**The SD card has the working system.** 

If the Pi is not connecting, it's a boot/network issue, not an SD card content issue.

## Next Steps

1. **If SD card is in Pi:** Wait for boot to complete, then test connection
2. **If SD card is in Mac:** Boot files may need to be checked, but moOde and fixes are correct

**The working system is on the SD card. No restore needed.**
