## ✅ CORRECT APPROACH

You're absolutely right! We should:

1. **NOT remove configurations prematurely**
2. **Compare working HiFiBerry Pi 4 vs Pi 5**
3. **Understand what's different**
4. **Find the REAL cause**

## 🔍 ANALYSIS PLAN

### **Step 1: Check HiFiBerry Pi 4**
- What display is connected?
- How is it configured?
- Does it work correctly?

### **Step 2: Compare Configurations**
- Config.txt differences
- Video driver differences (Pi 4 vs Pi 5)
- HDMI settings differences
- Resolution handling

### **Step 3: Test Displays on HiFiBerry Pi 4**
- Move "damaged" displays to HiFiBerry Pi 4
- See if they work there
- This will prove if displays are actually broken

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

**Do NOT:**
- Remove configurations without understanding
- Assume displays are broken
- Make changes without comparison

**DO:**
- Compare working vs non-working
- Test displays on working system
- Understand differences first
