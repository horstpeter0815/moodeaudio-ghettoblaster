# Prevent basic.target from implicitly waiting for dbus.service
# This breaks the circular dependency cycle
#
# dbus.service will start before basic.target (via Before=basic.target in dbus.service)
# But basic.target should NOT wait for it
#
# paths.target and slices.target are simple targets that complete immediately
# Don't wait for them in After= - just want them
