## Next Steps

### 1. Create Agents (10-15 minutes)

Follow `CREATE_MOODE_AGENTS_GUIDE.md` to create:

1. **Network Configuration Agent**
   - Helps with network setup and troubleshooting
   - Uses knowledge base for moOde network configs

2. **Documentation Generator Agent**

   - Assists with deployment

### 2. Test Agents (5 minutes)

Test each agent with real moOde tasks:
- "Check network configuration"
- "Generate documentation for network scripts"
- "Is the build ready for deployment?"

### 3. Advanced Features (5 minutes)

- Enable context memory (remembers project structure)
- Create prompt templates for common tasks
- Configure agent tools and permissions
