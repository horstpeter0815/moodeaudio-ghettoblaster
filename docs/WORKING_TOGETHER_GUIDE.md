# Working Together Guide

**Purpose:** How to effectively work with Auto (me) on your moOde Audio project

## 🎯 Best Practices for Clear Instructions

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific:** "Set up GitHub MCP" vs "fix something"
- **State your goal:** "I want to [goal] so I can [benefit]"
- **Provide context:** "The display shows X but I want Y"
- **Give examples:** Show me what you're working with
- **Ask questions:** "How do I...?" or "Can you help me...?"

### ❌ DON'T:
- Be vague: "Fix it" or "Make it work"
- Assume I know context: Always provide background
- Skip steps: Tell me the full picture
- Rush: Take time to explain what you need

## 📋 Template for Giving Instructions

### For Setup/Tasks:
```
Goal: [What you want to achieve]
Context: [Background information]
Current State: [What's happening now]
Desired State: [What you want]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### Example:
```
Goal: Set up GitHub MCP so you can read moOde source code
Context: I'm working on custom moOde build
Current State: GitHub MCP configured but no API key
Desired State: GitHub MCP working with my token
Priority: High
```

- Ask for confirmation if needed

### 4. I Implement
- Make changes
- Test if possible
- Document changes

### 5. You Review
- Check if it works
- Give feedback
- Request adjustments if needed

## 📚 What I Can Do

### ✅ I Can:
- Read and analyze your codebase
- Make code changes
- Create scripts and configuration files
- Search for information
- Run terminal commands
- Update documentation
- Help with debugging

## 🎓 You're Practicing!

This is a learning process. Here's what helps:

1. **Start small:** Begin with simple requests
2. **Build up:** Gradually try more complex tasks
3. **Give feedback:** Tell me what works, what doesn't
4. **Be patient:** I'll ask questions if I need clarification
5. **Learn patterns:** Notice what instructions work best

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Right now, you can try:**

1. **Set up a service:**
   ```
   "Set up GitHub MCP. I'll get the token and give it to you."
   ```

2. **Ask a question:**
   ```
   "How does the display configuration work?"
   ```

3. **Request documentation:**
   ```
   "Create a guide for [topic]"
   ```

4. **Fix something:**
   ```
   "Check if [thing] is configured correctly"
   ```

## 📝 Remember

- **Be clear:** Specific instructions work best
- **Provide context:** Help me understand what you need
- **Give feedback:** Tell me if something works or not
- **Ask questions:** I'm here to help!
- **Practice:** The more we work together, the better we'll get
