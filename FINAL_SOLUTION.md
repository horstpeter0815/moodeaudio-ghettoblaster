# 🎯 Final Solution - Connection Issue

**Status:** Ethernet not working, WiFi might work

---

## 🔧 ALTERNATIVE: Use WiFi

**We configured WiFi for "Centara Nova Hotel"**

**Try:**
1. **Connect Mac to WiFi:** "Centara Nova Hotel"
2. **Find Pi on WiFi network** (I'll scan)
3. **Access moOde via WiFi IP**

## 🔍 OR: Check What's Actually Wrong

**Since Ethernet isn't working, possible issues:**

1. **Pi Ethernet port not working** (hardware)
2. **Services not executing** (need to check logs)
3. **Pi stuck in boot** (need to check Pi screen)
4. **Network conflict** (something blocking)

**But we can't check without Pi access!**

## 🎯 SIMPLEST SOLUTION

**Since we've restored working moOde:**

1. **Try WiFi** - Connect Mac to "Centara Nova Hotel", I'll find Pi
2. **Or check Pi screen** - What IP does it show?
3. **Or use different network** - Home network instead of hotel?

**Let's try WiFi - it might work better than Ethernet!**
