## 🎯 TRY THESE NOW

### **1. Browser Access**
**Try in browser:**
- `http://192.168.10.2`
- `http://moode.local`
- `http://raspberrypi.local`

**Sometimes HTTP works even if ping doesn't!**

---

### **2. Wait Longer**
**Pi might need 3-4 minutes total to:**
- Boot completely
- Run all services
- Configure network
- Start moOde web server

---

### **3. Check Pi Screen**
**If display is connected:**
- What IP does it show?
- Any error messages?

---

## 🔧 IF STILL NOT WORKING

**We might need to:**
1. Check Pi logs (if we can SSH in)
2. Verify services are actually running
3. Check for hardware issues
4. Try different approach

---

**Try browser first - HTTP often works when ping doesn't!**
