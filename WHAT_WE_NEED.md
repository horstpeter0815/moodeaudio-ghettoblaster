# 🎯 What We Need

## Current Situation

**SD card has NO moOde installation:**
- Only 2 wizard files
- No moOde web files
- No moOde PHP files
- No moOde configuration

**Backup is incomplete:**
- Only has wizard files
- Doesn't have actual moOde

## What We Need

**To fix this, we need ONE of these:**

1. **Original moOde image file** (`.img` file)
   - Can be flashed to SD card
   - Then we add our fixes

2. **Working moOde SD card** (different card)
   - Can backup from that
   - Then restore to this card

3. **moOde installation source**
   - Installation script
   - Package files
   - Source code

## Question for You

**Where is the working moOde?**
- Is it on a different SD card?
- Do you have a moOde image file?
- Should we download/install moOde fresh?

---

**Without the actual moOde files, we can't restore it!**
